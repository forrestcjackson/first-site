		<p>Bikes are the best! I've had four so far, and I just bought my first dirt bike. It's the most fun I've had on a bike so far since I can fall and get back up without freaking out about scratching my <em>pretty</em> paint.</p>
		<h3>Fun stuff you can do on dirt bikes</h3>

				<li>Sick jumps</li>
				<li><a href="pics/swingarmw.png">Mediocre wheelies</a></li>
				<li><a href="pics/bail-lol.png">Crash</a></li>
				<li>Get up</li>
				<li>Go wherever you want</li>

	<p>I go to <a href="https://www.thumpertalk.com/index">Thumpertalk</a> forums often and the layout seems pretty good. I recognize the title on the tab, paragraphs, lists, breaks, anchoring, images, and just the basic layout of the HTML. I don't recognize any of the scripts or styling, the CSS, classes, or things like 'xmln:fb' </p>
