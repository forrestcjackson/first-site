	<p>I go to <a href="https://www.thumpertalk.com/index">Thumpertalk</a> forums often and the layout seems pretty good. I recognize the title on the tab, paragraphs, lists, breaks, anchoring, images, and just the basic layout of the HTML. I don't recognize any of the scripts or styling, the CSS, classes, or things like 'xmln:fb' </p>
